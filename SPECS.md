# tune-ai Specifications

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to facilitate the learning and creation of electronic music (specifically Techno and House) using TidalCycles. The process will be assisted by an AI, with this repository serving as the central hub for specifications, code, and compositions.

## 2. Specification Library

This table lists all the formal specification documents for the project.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`specs/environment-setup.md`](./specs/environment-setup.md) | Details the software and tools required, and the setup process. |
| [`specs/project-structure.md`](./specs/project-structure.md) | Defines the directory layout for organizing files. |
| [`specs/techno-production-guide.md`](./specs/techno-production-guide.md) | A practical tutorial for composing Techno with TidalCycles. |
| [`specs/house-production-guide.md`](./specs/house-production-guide.md) | A practical tutorial for composing House music with TidalCycles. |

## 3. Open Questions / Future Work

- [ ] Document the workflow for collaborating with the AI assistant.
- [ ] Create initial `.tidal` template files for each genre based on the new guides.
- [ ] Explore advanced TidalCycles functions for arrangement and variation.

## 4. Implementation Plan
