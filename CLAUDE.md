# tune-ai

Rust music workstation. First milestone: a faithful Rust port of the Open303
TB-303 emulation, rendered through the `tune` CLI.

## Layout

- `crates/tune-dsp` - DSP library (`param`, `acid303/*`, `fx/*`). No Tauri, UI,
  MCP, `cc` or `open303-ref` dependencies (`open303-ref` only as a dev-dependency).
- `crates/tune-cli` - the `tune` binary (`render.rs`, clap CLI).
- `crates/open303-ref` - dev-only C++ reference build used for parity tests.
- `third_party/open303/` - vendored Open303 sources, unmodified.
- `scripts/` - privacy check and its tests. `.githooks/` - pre-commit hook.
- `docs/` - design spec, plans, research.

## Rules

- Run `task verify` before every commit. Run `task setup` once per clone to
  enable the pre-commit privacy hook.
- Atomic commits, one concern each, conventional-commit messages.
- Privacy: never commit audio files, absolute home paths, email addresses, real
  names or other machine-specific data. `scripts/check-privacy.sh` enforces it.
  Use generic placeholders such as `~/Downloads/...` in docs.
- Never commit audio of any kind (renders, samples, reference tracks).
- Parity: the Rust port must match the C++ reference (compiled with
  `-O2 -std=c++14 -ffp-contract=off`). Module-level tolerance is 1e-12 max abs
  diff, full-voice 1e-9. If a test fails, find the cause (a missed `float` cast,
  operation order, a default); never loosen the tolerance. Mirror every C++
  `float` cast and member exactly (`as f32 as f64` where C++ narrows).
- Determinism: same inputs give bitwise-identical output; no unseeded
  randomness, no time-dependent behaviour.
- No GPL code (e.g. JC303) may be copied. Open303 is MIT and attributed in
  `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
