This repository documents my journey into the world of algorithmic music creation using [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/). I'll be using Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, to assist me in this learning process.

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this project is to learn how to create music with code, specifically with TidalCycles. This repository will serve as a collection of my experiments, notes, and compositions as I explore its capabilities.

## 🤖 The Process

I'll be using this space to:
- ✍️ Write and experiment with TidalCycles patterns.
- 📚 Keep notes and document my learning.
- 🎶 Compose and save musical ideas.
- 🤖 Collaborate with an AI assistant to accelerate my learning.

## What is TidalCycles?

TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a live coding environment for making patterns with code. It is a powerful tool for creating complex musical patterns from simple components.

Let the live coding begin!
